Final Project

### The Problem:

We are an online marketing firm that has been hired to draw clientelle to a new cannabis dispensary.
We are recieving a commission for every customer who follows the link from our adverts back to the dispensary
Website.

How do we target our ads to maximize responses while minimizing the number of ads we run?

We pay for every user who views our ads, but only get paid for those who follow the link.
This means we need to accurately target our ads to get the best link/view rate as possible.

### Work

Using data from the UCI data sets collection.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29

We will narrow down a general profile for who to target with our ads using ggplot and plotly
graphs to visualize what factors make a person a more likely customer, and what profile(s) most
commonly have those factors.

### Technical Objectives
